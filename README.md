My project is about my spofify data. My motivation for this project is understanding my music listening habits across different seasons and musical taste shift. This can be driven by a desire to explore patterns how they vary over time. I used spotify data such as json files and excel. I used pyhton, pandas and convert it into dataframes then did visual stuff such as graphs and maps Explored the most frequently listened-to songs for each season or artist.Dived into the distribution of genres and see if there are any shifts over time. The data includes information about songs played, artists, play durations, and timestamps. Limitations were the streaminghistorys did not have genres but i collect my playlist data so i did have the genres. 
So to summarize it, I took a peek into my Spotify data to see what my music habits are all about. I dived into the seasons, checking out how long I play to songs, what genres I'm into, and which artists steal the spotlight each season.
